This repository is a YAML represnetation for Rollout configuration, it is connected (see badge for status) to Rollout service via [Rollout's github app](https://github.com/apps/rollout-io)
Configuration as code allows the entire configuration of Rollout's state to be stored as source code. It integrates Rollout's UI with engineering existing environment. This approach brings a lot of benefits.
